# if passworth authentication is used, this is the password to use when
# being authorized by with server
password : "fabulous"

# Storage location of client data. This is where the client will store files 
# that it generates for persistence, like a database of unsent messages
dataDir : "${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/data"

# Mount point. This is the location where we mount the FUSE file system
rootDir : "${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/root"

# Private keyfile. This is the private key that we use to authenticate
# the with the server. It serves as our identity. The key must be an RSA key in 
# DER format. You may generate such a key using OpenSSL with the following 
# commands:
#
#   $ openssl genrsa -out id_rsa 3072
#   $ openssl pkcs8 -nocrypt -in id_rsa -topk8 -outform DER -out id_rsa.der
privKeyFile : "${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/rsa-openssl-priv.der"

# Public keyfile. This serves as the clients's "identity" and is used to
# verify that the client is who he says he is. The key must be
# an RSA key in DER format. You may generate such a key using OpenSSL with the
# following commands:
#
#   $ openssl genrsa -out id_rsa 3072
#   $ openssl rsa -in id_rsa -pubout -outform DER -out id_rsa_pub.der
pubKeyFile  : "${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/rsa-openssl-pub.der"

# Address family of interface to bind to. Options are AF_INET (IPv4) or 
# AF_INET6 (IPv6), or AF_UNSPEC to pick any one which matches the following
# criteria
addressFamily : AF_INET

# Interface to bind to. This is the IP address that the client uses to 
# communicate with the server. You may enter a IPv4 (xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx) or IPv6 
# (xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx) address, a hostname 
# (obfs.openbk.net), or the string "any" to bind to any available interface
iface : any

# Server location in [HOSTNAME]:[PORT] format. 
server : localhost:3031

# Size of the worker pool. The worker pool does work. Work is usually rather
# short so this doesn't have to be too large.
maxWorkers : 20
