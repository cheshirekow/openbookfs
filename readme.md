Openbook Filesystem
==================

The openbook filesystem is a fuse-based file synchronizer. Once the fuse
filesystem is mounted file synchronization happens in the background. We're
planning to use a Bayou-like peer-to-peer synchronization strategy, however
at this point in time we're developing the system to use a dedicated server. 

Doxygen
--------

You can find doxygen documentation [here][1]. The doxygen mainpage has
build instructions for Ubuntu 12.04 (though they are quite generic).
